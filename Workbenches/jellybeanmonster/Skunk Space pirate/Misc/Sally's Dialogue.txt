Captain Stench Dialogue




First Meeting:

Sally Stench: G'day, mate. Name's (Sally/Sara) Stench, space pirate, captain of the Phantom Sixx and, well, sole survivor of a bloody ambush. My ship's been blown to smithereens, and my crew... "Ace", "Strix", "Phila", "Ro", "Likka"....they've all been taken out.

Player: That sounds awful. Are you okay?

Sally Stench: I've seen better days, that’s for sure. One of my crew, Ace, he saved me at the last second, shoved me into an evacuation pod before the whole thing went up. Poor bloke didn't make it. I crash-landed here, and all my gear's buggered from the impact.

Player: That’s a lot to take in. What are you doing here?

Sally Stench: Was scoutin' this planet for a while. Knew it had some rare materials – gold, platinum, that sort of thing. Now I need 'em more than ever to fix my equipment. Can’t believe me luck, eh? Me ship's gone, crew's gone... everything. But I can’t take back what's already happened. No wucka's, cant fix the unfixable.

Player: Sounds like you've been through a lot.

Sally Stench: Too right. This place... it'll be me last plunder land. Got no one left to adventure with. Thought I'd be sailing the stars forever, but fate had other plans. So here I am, askin' you, stranger, got any of those rare materials? Gold, platinum, anything to get me back on my feet?

Player: ponders for a moment

Sally Stench: And listen, I know trust ain't easy to come by, but maybe we can be allies. I may not have a ship, but I’ve got skills and knowledge. Could be useful to ya.

Player: offers two responses

    A: “Alright, (Sally/Sara). You’ve got yourself an ally. I’ll help you out. We’ve got some gold and platinum around here. Let’s get you back on your feet.”
	
	Sally Stench: Cheers, mate. You’re a lifesaver. I owe ya one. Let’s get this show on the road and see what we can scrounge up. I won’t let ya down.
--------
    B: “Sorry, (Sally/Sara). I can’t take that risk. We’ve got enough trouble as it is without adding a space pirate to the mix. You’ll have to find help elsewhere.”
	
	Sally Stench: Fair dinkum, I get it. Can’t say I blame ya. I’ll find me own way then. Thanks anyway, mate. No hard feelings.

--------
Already Met dialogue:
Stench: "Ahoy there mate, ya back to recruit me on some ventures yeah?"

Player: 
A: "Sure, let's go."
------
B: "Not today, sorry."

Stench: "No worries, I'm all ears."

After recruited(Player chat dialogue):

"Top of me class at Space Pilot Uni, can ya believe it? Graduated when I was just 16. Ain't bad for an orphan from a dustball like Eridania, right?"

"Life on Eridania was a bloody struggle, mate. Learned to survive by any means necessary. Thievin' became second nature, no regrets there."

"Loot and treasure, now that's what gets me heart racin'. Nothin' like findin' a chest full of shiny goodies after a long day's plunderin'."

"Love havin' a good crew around me. Makes the journey a helluva lot more fun. Miss the Phantom Sixx somethin' fierce, though."

"I can knock back a few drinks, no worries. Might say I’m a bit of a boozehound, but hey, keeps the edge off, ya know?"

"Parties are my jam, especially with a good bit of grog. Dancin', drinkin', and a little bit of trouble, that's the life for me."

"Stealin' feels like a full-time job sometimes. It's a tough gig, but someone's gotta do it. No one was there for me when I needed help, so bugger what anyone else thinks."

"The law? Don’t get me started on those drongos. Spent years dodgin' space cops and their so-called justice. They're more corrupt than the crooks they chase."

"Yeggy, me trusty saber, ain’t just a pretty blade. Got hidden powers activated by gemstones. Still figurin' out what it can really do."

"My laser pistol, I call it the 'pew pew', is a real beaut. Fast fire rate, deadly accurate, and made by the brilliant Phila. Can’t imagine goin' into battle without it."

"This reflector I nabbed from a law carriage has saved me arse more times than I can count. Projectin' a holographic shield against projectiles is bloody handy."

"Me Phantom Badge is a piece of work, lemme tell ya. Phila made it, allows me to phase through solid objects. Perfect for breakin' into safes and avoidin' gunfire."

"Ace was me best mate, taught me how to shoot. Rarely ever missed a shot, that bloke. We met back at Space Pilot Uni, and he became my right hand in the Phantom Sixx."

"Strix, the Phantom Viper, was a stealth genius. Freed him from the Hoodwink Rovers, and he joined us. His conniving attitude fit perfectly with mine."

"Phila was the mastermind behind all our gear. She built my rocket boots, laser pistol, and the scouter. Couldn’t have asked for a better engineer."

"Ro saved me from a prison cell and became our spy. Former space cop turned rebel, he knew all their tricks. Without him, I’d probably still be locked up."

"Likka may not have been a fighter, but she kept us fed and our ship spotless. Her cooking was the best in the galaxy. We all appreciated her more than she knew."

"This planet’s got some gnarly creatures I’ve never seen before. Giant worms, spiders, demons, you name it. Keeps things interestin', that's for sure."

"Those dark purple wastelands give me the creeps. Death and decay everywhere you look. Makes ya wonder what happened here."

"The fleshy infection biome is somethin' else. red gore and flesh spreadin' slowly. It’s eerie but fascinatin' at the same time."

"These abandoned mines are full of mystery and potential. Explorin' underground feels like divin' into a lost world. Who knows what treasures lie beneath?"

"The law’s full of contradictions, and that’s why I rebel against it. They enforce rules that benefit the powerful and oppress the weak. No way I’m standin' for that."

"Stealin' from others might be horrible, but it’s a way of life for me. Grew up with nothin', so takin' what I need is second nature. No one helped me, so I owe 'em nothin'."

"I miss my crew every day. This place will be my last plunder land without them. It’s not the same adventurin' alone."
"Even in this post-apocalyptic world, there’s always somethin' interestin' to find. Keeps the explorer in me alive. Who knows what secrets this planet holds?"

"Phila’s gadgets were top-notch, unmatched by anyone else. She was a wizard with tech, always comin' up with somethin' new. The crew wouldn’t have been the same without her."

"The evil biomes on this planet are spreadin', slowly takin' over. Makes ya wonder what caused 'em. Somethin' sinister, no doubt."

"Giant worms and disfigured monstrosities? This planet’s got it all. Never a dull moment here, that’s for sure."

"Findin' Ace in Space Pilot Uni was a stroke of luck. He was my best mate and taught me so much. Miss him more than words can say."

"This planet’s a goldmine for scavengers like me. So much potential for findin' somethin' unique. Every day’s an opportunity."

"Haven’t been caught by the law since Ro joined. He knew all their tricks and how they operated. Thanks to him, we stayed one step ahead."

"The Phantom Badge is my favorite piece of tech. Can’t imagine life without it. Bein' able to phase through objects is a game-changer."

"Every day here’s a new adventure, full of surprises. Keeps me on my toes. Never know what you’ll run into next."

"The corruption in the law makes me sick. They enforce rules that benefit the powerful and oppress the weak. No way I’m standin' for that."

"Explorin' underground feels like divin' into a lost world. The potential for unique finds is massive. Who knows what treasures lie beneath?"

"Life’s too short to worry 'bout what’s right or wrong. I do what I need to survive. If that means stealin', so be it."

"Ace was the Phantom Trigger, our sharpshooter. Rarely missed a shot. I owe a lot of my skills to him."

"Strix was the Phantom Viper, stealthier than a shadow. His tricks and tactics kept us out of more scraps than I can count."

"Phila, the Phantom Mastermind, was a genius with tech. Her inventions made us the best crew in the galaxy."

"Ro, the Phantom Eye, knew all the ins and outs of the law. His info kept us one step ahead. Without him, we’d have been caught ages ago."

"Likka, the Phantom Amah, kept us fed and our ship tidy. Her cookin' was the best, and we all loved her for it."

"The evil biomes here are spreadin', takin' over. Makes ya wonder what kind of catastrophe hit this place."

"Giant worms, spiders, and demons – this planet’s full of 'em. Each day brings a new challenge, and I love it."

"Those dark purple wastelands are eerie. Death and decay everywhere. It’s a harsh reminder of what can happen."

"The fleshy infection biome is like somethin' out of a nightmare. scarlet gore spreadin' slowly. It’s both fascinatin' and terrifyin'."

"Every abandoned mine is a new adventure. Never know what you’ll find underground."

"The law’s a joke, full of contradictions. I’d rather be a thief than a hypocrite. At least I’m honest about it."

"Stealin' might be wrong, but it’s how I survive. No one helped me when I was down, so I do what I have to. Bugger what anyone else thinks."

"Missin' my crew every day. This place will be my last plunder land without them. The adventure ain’t the same alone."
