1."Ah! How Dee there stranger, I'm Captain Sally Stench and me ship was blasted by some space rats while scouting here planet. My cadets seem to have been killed in the crash landin. Before arrivin here I was scouting this planet and there seems to be lots of rare and useful materials underneath the soil, yeah?"

Choices> (A)Yes there is

2."Do you by any chance have some rare metals like gold or platinum?"
"If you do it would really help me out as my equipment is damaged from the crash and i am unable to defend myself. If you give me 15 gold and platinum bars I will be in debt to you and a VERY useful companion if needed."

Choices> (A)Give materials/(B)I dont have the materials right now/C No

3. A Response(Recruit)- Thank you, these materials will be put to good use. Rest assured you won't be disappointed. Now then im ready for adventure when you are.

Already Met dialogue: "Ahoy there mate, are you back to recruit me on your ventures yeah?"


After recruited(General/Self dialogue):
RNG Dialogue-
-Before coming to this planet i was a space pirate captain, going around taking things from other worlds.
-My weapons are a plasma falchion and arm blaster. I stole both from a ship me and my crew hijacked while traversing space.
-Unfortunately I am the only one who survived the crash of my ship. My cadets won't get to enjoy the treasures we will find.
-My plasma falchion seems to have a empty socket for a gemstone to fit in wonder what it would do?
-If you ever come across any gemstones make sure to share them with me. I want to find out the true power of my blade.
-Forgot to mention my phantasm device has taken damage also if you have any spare platinum/gold bars you could help fix it. 20 bars is all it would need.

Condition based dialogue:
While nearby metals or gemstones:
-My scouter is picking up high volumes of rare materials here just keep up your mining it will be all ours soon enough.

While nearby enemies:
-My scouter is showing a hostile entities, look out for a ambush.

While nearby traps:
-My scouter is picking up danger signals in this area watchout for traps.

Reviving:
Reviving player- Oh no! don't end up like my cadets we have so much more treasure to find!
Player reviving- Once more im in debt to you I hope my performance in combat wont be this lackluster next time...
Revived without help- A helping hand would have been useful you know....
