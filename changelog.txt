Increased the chance of Alexander recruit npc appearing in his spawn biome.
Added a setting to disable shared health and mana increase items progress among companions of same type.
 => This option will no longer make health and mana increase items no longer have their progress shared among the same companion through your player saves.
 => That option will be effective as soon as you flip it on/off.
Skills one will be implemented in the future.
