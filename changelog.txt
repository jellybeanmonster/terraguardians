Companions will now check differently if they can revive a companion, instead of using the player revive check too.
Fixed a issue where some companions could still count as activated when being affected by action, after despawning.
Vladimir will no longer disappear when hugging a town npc.
You can no longer abuse of mounting on a companion + asking it to lift your character to fly to the sky.
Enabling God Mode on Journey Mode worlds will now set follower companions Health and Mana to max value too, and make them immune to death.
 => I mean, it's good mode, right?
