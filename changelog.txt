Modders can now change which requests and rewards could be acquired on the mod.
 => For changing Request types to receive, use RequestContainer.GetRequest to get a request by its id and mod id.
 =>  => Change the value of "AllowTakingRequest" to false, and that request will never be offered.
 =>  => Check if the returned Boolean value is true before trying that. 
 => For Request Rewards, you can access directly the reward list.
 =>  => Due to the way it's made, you need to look for the rewards by item id if you want to remove.

Changed how request rewards are given:

 => Now:
 =>  => The minimum chance for getting no extra reward from level 7 and ahead is 1%, and the chance lowers with friendship level.
Added new request types:
 => Invasion type requests.
 =>  => Those request types will have a number of monster spawn around your character, until all the monsters are defeated.
 => Item Gathering type requests.
 =>  => Those requests will ask you to collect certain items that can be found on the game world.
